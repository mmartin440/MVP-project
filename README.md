CARZ is a web application where you can go check out what cars are currently on sale, and their contact information to contact them about the car. 
As a new user you can sign up, create your own account and be able to sell a car or take down a current car on sale. 


# Challenges 
This is my first full stack application so there were a lot of things that I had complications with such as keeping the user signed in after they logged in. 
I could have stored the user's name in a global variable to make sure they stay logged in, and not have to sign in every time. Another challenge I faced was not being able to get instant updates when a change was done.
